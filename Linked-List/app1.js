// Remove every k-th node of the linked list

// Given a singly linked list, the task is to remove every kth node of the linked list. Assume that k is always less than or equal to the length of the Linked List.

// Input: LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6, k = 2
// Output: 1 -> 3 -> 5
// Explanation: After removing every 2nd node of the linked list, the resultant linked list will be: 1 -> 3 -> 5 .

// Input: LinkedList: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10, k = 3
// Output: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10
// Explanation: After removing every 3rd node of the linked list, the resultant linked list will be: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10.
