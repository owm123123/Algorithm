// * Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
// Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
// According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

// Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

// Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
// Output: 1
